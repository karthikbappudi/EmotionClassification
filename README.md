# EmotionClassification


**Trained a  multiclass classfier for classifing emotions into 6 emotions. The dataset used for this is emotions dataset from huggingface's dataset library**

**pls go through the repo, the api cannot be replacated on you local system, since the model could not be uploaded and limit for uploading files is 25 mb.**


# Further Improvements that can be done for this project


1.   Minority classes can be oversampled by adding new data or by augmenting using paraphrase generatibe models.

2.   Different Encoder type transfoemrs like RoBerTa, Bert can be trained and benchmarked.

3. Hypermaters can be tuned using optuna for further optimization.
4. Error handlers could be added to the flask api.
